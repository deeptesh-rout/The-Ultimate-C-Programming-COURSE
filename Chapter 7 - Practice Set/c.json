	// Place your snippets for c here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"C boilerplate": {
		"prefix": "c boiler",
		"body": [
			"#include <stdio.h>\n",
			"int main(){", 
			"\t$0", 
			"\treturn 0;",
			"}",
			
		],
		"description": "The C language boilerplate"
	},
	"myprintf": {
		"prefix": "myprintf",
		"body": [
			"printf(\"$0 \\n\");\n", 
			
		],
		"description": "The C language boilerplate"
	}
